# Color Image Compression using Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

## Data
The image given is a 120x120 full-color image (flowers.ppm). This image can also be 
treated as a 120 x 120 x 3 matrix, representing a 3-dimensional feature space of 
120 x 120 samples.

## Tasks
Complete the following tasks using k-means, winner-take-all, and Kohonen maps (SOM):
* Find the 256, 128, 64, 32, etc. colors that best represent the image
* Compare the image to the full color image using some metrics.

Use mean shift to automatically determine the optimal colors based on a given bandwidth
