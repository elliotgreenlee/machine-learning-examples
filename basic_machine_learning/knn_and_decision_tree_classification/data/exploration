The original data is a csv file without headers.
Headers are given in the project description, and have been added to the data file.
Sample Code Number, Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, Mitoses, Class
All values are integers from one to ten. The class is a binary option: two for benign and four for malignant
There are 16 rows missing values in the Bare Nuclei column. These rows are removed, because we have no prior knowledge of this domain.
The Sample Code number is removed from analysis because it is an index value rather than data.
No standardization is applied to the data, because each ranges between integer values one and ten. This will also allow the decision tree rules to be interpreted later by medical professionals.
The data for our analysis has nine features and one class label
